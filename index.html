            <p>
                Hunter "El Casador" Anderton is a young bachelor, age 16, and a man who enjoys the finer things
             in life. He loves to hunt(no pun intended), play football, and take long walks on the beach by moonlight.

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>
                On a nice afternoon, one may find Hunter in solitude, helping himself toa good book, doing 
                laundry, or watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostbusters_(franchise)" 
                target="_blank">Ghostbusters</a>. He is also a D&D blackbelt, a master in the arts of hula dancing,
                and has a degree in Barbie Doll Fashion. However, at night you will most likely find him fighting 
                crime, taking down the mafia, and <a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/punch-ezTxtrn27dMly" target="_blank">

              <h2>Origin Story</h2>
              <p>
                  At the age of 10, Hunter loved going to playgrounds and adventuring in the woods. One day,
                  he adventured too far and ran into a hunter's hut. This man bit him and gave him the
                  powers of a hunter, and ever since then, "El casador" has been roaming the streets of Lehi, 
                  fighting criminals and small-time thugs.

              <p>
                  Some of his favorite foods include pasta, pizza and hamburgers. However, after a tough fight,
                  El Casador loves sneaking danish pastries from the danish pastry jar.
